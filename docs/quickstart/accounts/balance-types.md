# Balance Types

When you view your account information, for example through Polkadot UI, you may see multiple subsections of balances.



`Total`: The total EDG, without excluding any type.

`Transferable`: The amount of EDG that you can use or transfer.

`Reserved`: The amount of EDG used or bonded for Governance actions, like voting, elections, or proposals.

`Bonded`: The amount of EDG bonded to use for staking, including validation and nomination. 

`Locked`: The total amount of unusable EDG you have, the sum of `reserved` and `bonded`
