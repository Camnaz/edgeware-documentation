# Check your Balance via Block Explorer

At this time, the two main block explorers are 

* [Polkascan](https://polkascan.io/pre/edgeware-berlin)
* [Subscan](https://edgeware.subscan.io/)

Both of these explorers will only work with Public Addresses \(SS58\) that have the Edgeware network ID encoded.

{% hint style="info" %}
 If you have not re-encoded your public address from you Lockdrop-created keypair with the new Edgeware network ID, you **must do so** in order to use block explorers to find your account.  Follow the instructions linked below.
{% endhint %}

{% page-ref page="regenerating-keys-with-edgeware-network-id.md" %}

Once you have your re-encoded Public Address, you can enter it into the search bar in a block explorer to pull up your account and view the balance.
