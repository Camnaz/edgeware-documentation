## One-person-one vote - what will prevent malicious players from signing on multiple nodes if it will cost little?

We provide a variety of tallying rules for certain governance features on Edgeware. The core governance is run with coin-weighted voting, with extensions that mimic a form of quadratic voting based on locking time \(I.e you get more weight by locking longer\). Therefore what you ask is not wholly correct. Some tally types are inherently and unavoidably vulnerable to certain tactics- if someone wants to run a signaling poll with one person one vote thatâ€™s their decision, but we can provide guidance about results and process.
