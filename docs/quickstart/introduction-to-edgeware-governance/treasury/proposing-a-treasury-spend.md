# Proposing a Treasury Spend

When a stakeholder wishes to propose a spend from the treasury, **they must reserve a deposit totaling 5% of the proposed spend, with a minimum of 1000 EDG**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Parameter Note:**  The Treasury Spend Deposit is 5% of the proposed spend action, with a minimum of 1000 EDG.
{% endhint %}

**This deposit will be slashed if the proposal is rejected,** and returned if the proposal was accepted.

Proposals may consist of \(but are not limited to\):

* Infrastructure deployment and continued operation.
* Network security operations \(monitoring services, continuous auditing\).
* Ecosystem provisions \(collaborations with friendly chains\).
* Marketing activities \(advertising, paid features, collaborations\).
* Community events and outreach \(meetups, pizza parties, hackerspaces\).
* Software development \(wallets and wallet integration, clients and client upgrades\).
* Core Technology: Implementing of scaling technologies such as runtime improvements, sharding, and off-chain extensions.
* Governance: Governance systems, including on-chain identity as well as tools for organizing and coordinating the work of core developers. 
* Developer experience: A mature toolchain for developing, debugging, and testing smart contracts. 
* User experience: Wallets and user experience primitives \(e.g., JavaScript libraries\) to make decentralized apps simple and easy to use. â€¢ Ecosystem support: Engaging developers, end users, and other stakeholders through in-person events.

The treasury is ultimately controlled by the stakeholders, and how the funds will be spent is up to their judgment.
