# Staking

Edgeware uses a version of proof-of-stake called Nominated Proof-of-Stake, and stakers are split into two types:

* **Validators:** Node operators who secure the network and are backed by nominators and their own stake.
* **Nominators:** EDG holders who delegate/nominate their EDG to a validator and share in the benefits.  

See more details about these roles below:

## Validate

Validation requires establishing a node, setting up your account and keys, and bonding EDG in order to verify blocks and secure the network. Follow these steps, in order, to get started.
