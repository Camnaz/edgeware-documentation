## What is the minimum EDG to validate?

The validator set is limited, and to enter the set you must have more than the smallest amount of any validator in the set.

To find out the amount, you can select `staking.slotStake` from the chain-state section of [the Polkadot UI](http://polkadot.js.org/apps) once you are connected to Edgeware mainnet.
