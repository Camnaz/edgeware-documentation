In this post, weâ€™re providing more clarity on the technological capabilities of the Lockdrop event, and detailing why we've built the process this way.  


First and foremost, the Edgeware lockdrop event is a token distribution mechanism intended to:

1. Select for longterm, committed participants of the ETH community that want to participate in the developer-accessible \(Wasm runtime,\) secure, interoperable smart-contract platform, with radically community-owned governance, namely Edgeware. 
2. Distribute tokens to those entities in a more fair manner than previous token distribution mechanisms including initial coin offerings and others.

Accordingly, organizations that develop important infrastructure for the ecosystem have expressed significant interest in participating - these organizations, _regardless of size_,  have absolutely shown commitment, and sometimes even develop tools that we build from or will leverage later on.  In the interest of the health of the Edgeware network, by default, we are open to any participant that is willing to lock or signal ETH, and the more, the better.  


Further, we value one of the most basic norms of the blockchain ecosystem: possession of private keys is tantamount to ownership and control over the funds linked to those keys. Where one controls the private keys to a wallet or contract, one may signal or lock those funds.

To create higher standards - or a blacklist or whitelist beyond that would interfere with the open participation and selection goals of the lockdrop event.  


Finally, as Edgeware is a completely separate network from Ethereum, we ask that individuals concerned about the usage of ETH on that network, locked or otherwise, or who would seek to disenfranchise the control or alter the usage of funds by their private key owners, that they raise these concerns within the governance structures of Ethereum.
