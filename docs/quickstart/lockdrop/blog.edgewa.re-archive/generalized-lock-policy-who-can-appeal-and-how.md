# Generalized Lock Policy: Who Can Appeal and How

“If an address that calls ‘Signal’ is unable to sign a transaction with msg.value greater than 0 for the entirety of the 3, 6 or 12-month lock durations, that signal can be treated as a lock for the purposes of the allocation award.

\*\*\*\*

#### DEADLINE FOR APPEALS \(ADDED SEPT 10 2019\): <a id="deadline-for-appeals-added-sept-10-2019-"></a>

  
In order to finalize the genesis configuration, generalized lock appeals will be accepted until the deadline of:  
**Sept 13, 12:00 UTC \(8AM EST\)**  
We have three appeals at this time, they will be published openly after the deadline.  


[From our Final Terms of the Lockdrop Article](https://blog.edgewa.re/final-terms-and-updates-to-the-edgeware-lockdrop/), published May 31 2019:

“If an address that calls ‘Signal’ is unable to sign a transaction with msg.value greater than 0 for the entirety of the 3, 6 or 12-month lock durations, that signal _can_ be treated as a lock for the purposes of the allocation award.

These will be treated as a 3-month lock**\*** without early contribution bonuses, and at the end of the contribution period \(post-August 30th,\) will be added to the genesis spec of Edgeware, case-by-case. In these cases, we will strive to achieve the two goals outlined in [this article on the Lockdrop Norms.](https://blog.edgewa.re/lockdrop-norms/)“

**\***As of June 18,2019, based on community feedback and/or signaling proposals from current Lockdrop participants, the amount allocated to each General Lock participant may change.  These proposals will be published to [https://commonwealth.im](https://commonwealth.im/#!/signaling) for engagement and discussion by EDG address holders.
