## How many EDG will be minted in the genesis lockdrop event?

How many EDG will be minted in the genesis lockdrop event?

The genesis of the Edgeware network will mint 5 Billion EDG tokens.

Of this 5 Billion, 90%, or 4.5 billion will be distributed through the lockdrop process. The 10% remainder is distributed to:

4.5% to Commonwealth Labs, the developers of Edgeware, and will not be used to fund development. 3% to Parity Tech for support services on their Substrate product. 2.5% reserved for Community Incentives, OSS development, or other network success goals.

For the 90% distributed in the Lockdrop Event, lockdrop participants obtain 'shares' or the ability to obtain EDG at a certain proportion to their locked or signaled ETH. The following chart shows these share weights:

For [https://stats.edgewa.re](https://stats.edgewa.re) , we are planning to include a calculator with an estimation tool.

## Appealing for a Generalized Lock

In order to finalize the genesis configuration, generalized lock appeals will be accepted until the deadline of: **Sept 13, 12:00 UTC \(8AM EST\)**  
We have three appeals at this time, they will be published openly after the deadline.

[From our Final Terms of the Lockdrop Article](https://blog.edgewa.re/final-terms-and-updates-to-the-edgeware-lockdrop/), published May 31 2019:

“If an address that calls ‘Signal’ is unable to sign a transaction with msg.value greater than 0 for the entirety of the 3, 6 or 12-month lock durations, that signal _can_ be treated as a lock for the purposes of the allocation award.

These will be treated as a 3-month lock**\*** without early contribution bonuses, and at the end of the contribution period \(post-August 30th,\) will be added to the genesis spec of Edgeware, case-by-case. In these cases, we will strive to achieve the two goals outlined in [this article on the Lockdrop Norms.](https://blog.edgewa.re/lockdrop-norms/)“

**\***As of June 18,2019, based on community feedback and/or signaling proposals from current Lockdrop participants, the amount allocated to each General Lock participant may change. These proposals will be published to [https://commonwealth.im](https://commonwealth.im/#!/signaling) for engagement and discussion by EDG address holders.

### THE GENERALIZED LOCK APPEAL PROCESS IS AVAILABLE TO: <a id="the-generalized-lock-appeal-process-is-available-to-"></a>

## Signal vs Lock in the Lockdrop

In the Edgeware Lockdrop, you have two options for participation:

### LOCKING: <a id="locking-"></a>

Lock an amount of ETH into your Lockdrop User Contract \(LUC\) over a chosen duration of 3, 6 or 12 months to receive a greater proportion of EDG at network launch. There are also additional bonuses for locking sooner also - see the chart below for those. When the lock is initiated, the ETH moves from your control and will be released back to you 92 days or more \(depending on your chosen duration\) later - so when you get your ETH back always depends on when you lock and how long you lock for. Lock sooner, get the ETH back sooner.

Now, for the bonuses for locking, longer locks receive a greater weighted share of the final amount of EDG that is minted. That amount will be determined by the total amount of ETH locked in the Locked drop event. [Track that progress here at the Lockdrop Stats page.](https://edgewa.re/lockdrop/stats)![](https://blog.edgewa.re/content/images/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-03-at-9.09.13-AM.png)

The following table shows the final bonus schedule for locking sooner.

### SIGNALING: <a id="signaling-"></a>

If you signal, no ETH is moved, locked or otherwise removed from your control. It basically says "I want to participate in the Edgeware network!" and for this no-risk option, there are a few key features:

* No bonuses for locking sooner or longer, because this is not a lock.  
* Signaling earns less EDG per ETH - a ratio of 0.20x, amounting to a 80% reduction compared to a three-month lock.
* Signalers will not receive the full allocation of EDG at the network launch on Sept 15. They will be allocated 25% of their due share at launch, and the remaining 75% of their share will be delivered 365 days later.
* To participate in the signal, you only have to submit an ETH address containing ETH during the lockdrop contribution period \(June 1 - Aug 31 11:59 pm UTC,\) – however, you only need to have the ETH you intend to signal in that wallet on 'Snapshot Day' which is Sept 1, 12:00 am UTC. So, if you intend to signal, you could move ETH to a wallet on Sept 1, complete [the Lockdrop page,](https://edgewa.re/lockdrop) and then move your ETH out of that wallet the next day. There are no incentives to signal early or later, and it only matters where your ETH is on the Snapshot Day. See calendar below:

## Why participate in the Lockdrop?

You can earn fees as a validator, deploy WASM smart contracts to experiment with cutting-edge technology, and vote on the future of the network.

## **What if I re-signaled because I lost my EDG key but have full control over my ETH?**

There may be a small number of cases where a user signaled from an ETH account, mapping that address to an EDG account, but then lost the key to that EDG account. As a solution, they may have simply re-signaled from the ETH to a new EDG keypair.

Under this change, that second signal would _not_ be acknowledged. **Instead, that user should utilize their control of the ETH and send to another address, then conduct a signal from there.** This must be completed before the snapshot date of Sept 1 2019. **There is no way to utilize this option for a lock, only signals.**

## What happened with WithdrawDAO signal?

On July 2nd 2019, Nick Johnson, the deployer of a contract called the WithdrawDAO utilized it to signal roughly 123,000 ETH to the Edgeware Lockdrop.

Subsequently, he published the private key to the WithdrawDAO..

[See nick.eth's other Tweets](https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson)

This allowed anyone to re-signal using the funds stored in WithdrawDAO.

Now, the lockdrop process has a 'snapshot' function, that will activate at 00:00 UTC Sept 1. This snapshot looks at every ETH address that has sent a signal and checks the balance _at that time only_ \(preventing users from shuffling ETH around, signaling, and shuffling again to a new address.\)

If multiple signals map the same ETH to different Edgeware addresses, the lockdrop process must decide which EDG address should receive the allocation for that signal.

To solve this case, we've written into genesis process that an ETH address can only be signaled from _once_. All subsequent attempts to map it to a different EDG keypair will not be acknowledged. _\*\*_So, according to this condition, only the first signal from the WithdrawDAO will be processed: that of the deployer, Nick Johnson.

However, the funds that will be allocated to Johnson's EDG account are lost because he destroyed his Edgeware private key- and instead this is the first known reduction in the circulating supply of EDG at launch time.

## What were the final terms of the Lockdrop?

_Originally published 31 MAY 2019_

Today we are announcing:

* Changes to the meaning of lock and signal to be more inclusive of a variety of security preferences and increasing eligibility of participating ETH.
* Removing the caps on the bonus structures for locking _sooner,_ in order to provide more users a better opportunity for participating earlier.
* Capping allocated EDG to 20% of the network total for any individual lockdrop participant. 

### A GENERALIZED DEFINITION OF A ‘LOCK’ EVENT. <a id="a-generalized-definition-of-a-lock-event-"></a>

We’re adding a generalized definition to a ‘lock’ for the purposes of the Lockdrop contribution period: If an address that calls ‘Signal’ is unable to sign a transaction with msg.value greater than 0 for the entirety of the 3, 6 or 12-month lock durations, that signal _can_ be treated as a lock for the purposes of the allocation award. These will be treated as a 3-month locks without early contribution bonuses, and at the end of the contribution period \(post-August 30th,\) will be added to the genesis spec of Edgeware, case-by-case. In these cases, we will strive to achieve the two goals outlined in [this article on the Lockdrop Norms.](https://blog.edgewa.re/lockdrop-norms/)

This may include special cases like funds locked in _other lockdrops_ whose lock periods exceed 92 days \(the minimum lock duration in the Edgeware Lockdrop Event,\) only where a Lockdrop participant owns the private key to those wallets or contracts. In these cases, it would be theoretically possible for contract or wallet owners to concurrently participate in multiple lockdrops.

### WE’RE REMOVING THE CAPS ON THE BONUS PERIODS FOR LOCKING SOONER. <a id="we-re-removing-the-caps-on-the-bonus-periods-for-locking-sooner-"></a>

After listening to feedback on the timing of bonus tiers, we’ve decided to remove the caps for the bonus tiers for participating earlier so that the speed of the completion of the process is no longer as influential on the amount of EDG allocated. The new bonus schedule follows:![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZQfS4DN5NPAbX4gfxS7ixg4UJhU4ofyuSnEz8r-jiAWGfcnGG7gGmbfGq8QTzAv9zo7r0VXT_Y_ym-zBCLmxNWdi6C-WWfCLv5Z9W9bbcQEwW9tTrNSuDNGisOwekjjBstEUjBZ4)

### WE’RE INSTITUTING A HARD CAP OF 20% TO ANY INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTING ETH ADDRESS OR RECEIVING EDG ADDRESS. <a id="we-re-instituting-a-hard-cap-of-20-to-any-individual-contributing-eth-address-or-receiving-edg-address-"></a>

In order to reduce centralization of power on Edgeware and increase the diversity of stakeholder voice, no single contributing ETH address or receiving EDG address will be able to obtain greater than or equal to 20% of the total EDG minted through the Lockdrop. We’ll make sure this threshold is not reached by looking at the corresponding ‘Lock’ or ‘Signal’ events throughout the whole contribution period.

As a reminder, the final amount of EDG minted during genesis is 5 billion, 4.8 billion of which will be distributed through the Lockdrop Event. How many EDG each lockdrop participant earns is dependent on their 'shares' proportionally, where these proportions are modulated by the bonuses, including lock duration and participation start time. Estimating how many EDG you will recieve is difficult because it will vary on the total ETH locked, and this value will only be known at the end of the contribution period \(Aug 31 2019 11:59pm.\) Because of this timing, we encourage participants to overestimate how much ETH they plan to signal or lock in order to maximize their EDG earnings.

It’s been less than a year since we first announced [Edgeware](https://link.medium.com/AQ4MVOn18W). One of the goals that we articulated at that time was for Edgeware was to push forward on-chain governance. We think that seeding the treasury with any “individual contribution” above the 20% threshold is a good step in that direction. Through Edgeware governance, this treasury will be allocated through on-chain votes to support network development.

## Does the allocation for both signals and locks draw from the same pool?

Yes. Signalers and droppers pull from the same allocation pool, the unreserved 4,500,000,000 EDG Tokens that will be allocated to them at different ratios.

## What is a Lockdrop?

To align incentives, the Edgeware network will be launched with a lockdrop of EDG tokens to Ether holders. A lockdrop happens where token holders on one network timelock their tokens for a certain amount of time using a smart contract. For the Edgeware lockdrop, ETH holders may lock their tokens for as short as 3 months or as long as one year. Longer timelocks correspond to proportionally more EDG received.

## When does the Lockdrop and Signal period end?

Sunday, September 1, 2019 12:00:00 AM UTC

## How does signaling work?

In the Edgeware Lockdrop, you have two options for participation:

### LOCKING: <a id="locking-"></a>

Lock an amount of ETH into your Lockdrop User Contract \(LUC\) over a chosen duration of 3, 6 or 12 months to receive a greater proportion of EDG at network launch. There are also additional bonuses for locking sooner also - see the chart below for those. When the lock is initiated, the ETH moves from your control and will be released back to you 92 days or more \(depending on your chosen duration\) later - so when you get your ETH back always depends on when you lock and how long you lock for. Lock sooner, get the ETH back sooner.

Now, for the bonuses for locking, longer locks receive a greater weighted share of the final amount of EDG that is minted. That amount will be determined by the total amount of ETH locked in the Locked drop event. [Track that progress here at the Lockdrop Stats page.](https://edgewa.re/lockdrop/stats)![](https://blog.edgewa.re/content/images/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-03-at-9.09.13-AM.png)

The following table shows the final bonus schedule for locking sooner.  
![](https://blog.edgewa.re/content/images/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-01-at-10.00.14-AM.png)

### SIGNALING: <a id="signaling-"></a>

If you signal, no ETH is moved, locked or otherwise removed from your control. It basically says "I want to participate in the Edgeware network!" and for this no-risk option, there are a few key features:

* No bonuses for locking sooner or longer, because this is not a lock.  
* Signaling earns less EDG per ETH - a ratio of 0.20x, amounting to a 80% reduction compared to a three-month lock.
* Signalers will not receive the full allocation of EDG at the network launch on Sept 15. They will be allocated 25% of their due share at launch, and the remaining 75% of their share will be delivered 365 days later.
* To participate in the signal, you only have to submit an ETH address containing ETH during the lockdrop contribution period \(June 1 - Aug 31 11:59 pm UTC,\) – however, you only need to have the ETH you intend to signal in that wallet on 'Snapshot Day' which is Sept 1, 12:00 am UTC. So, if you intend to signal, you could move ETH to a wallet on Sept 1, complete [the Lockdrop page,](https://edgewa.re/lockdrop) and then move your ETH out of that wallet the next day. There are no incentives to signal early or later, and it only matters where your ETH is on the Snapshot Day. See calendar below:

### IMPORTANT DATES TO KNOW FOR SIGNALING AND LOCKING \(THE CHEATSHEET!\) TIMES ARE IN UTC! <a id="important-dates-to-know-for-signaling-and-locking-the-cheatsheet-times-are-in-utc-"></a>

![](https://blog.edgewa.re/content/images/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-03-at-9.55.10-AM.png)

## Why is signaling not a better option than locking ETH?

Beyond getting the bonus in the lockdrop for locking, the opportunity cost is with respect to the expected rewards of validating, which signalers have less advantage in due to their lower allocation ratio. \(We also don’t provide signalers a way to signal intent to validate\).

## Does signaling cost anything?

Signaling costs and takes nothing. No lockup, no transfer of your tokens to anything, just the delayed minting at a penalty. Our main goal is to get EDGE tokens into as wide a set of holders as is -humanly- possible: Without that, our aim of truly community-owned governance can't be a reality

## How can I verify if my signal or lock succeeded?

You can enter your participating ETH address/addresses at the following tool: [https://stats.edgewa.re/](https://stats.edgewa.re/)

## Where are the lockdrop contracts, have they been audited?

Contracts are in this Github Repo: [https://github.com/hicommonwealth/edge-lockdrop](https://github.com/hicommonwealth/edge-lockdrop)

Yes, the master lockdrop contract has been audited. [See the Quantstamp audit report here.](https://certificate.quantstamp.com/view/edge-lockdrop)

## Why set the only lock durations to 3, 6 or 12 months?

Not everyone is able to overcome the opportunity cost for locking Ethereum for an extended period of time. Having different schedules allows people to have different levels of skin in the game. A key goal of the Edgeware community is to provide a wide, openly participatory network. The lockdrop is a key part of that goal.

## Can you receive EDG even if you don't lock?

Correct: You can 'signal' and still receive EDG but at a penalty and a time-delay. 25% of EDG at launch, 75% one year later.

## Does at make a difference if you signal an EDG public key from an ‘ed25519’ \(Edwards\) or ‘sr25519’ \(Schnorrkel\) keypair?

No, all keys work.

## When will EDG be distributed?

Upon network launch all EDG allocated via the lockdrop will automatically exist at the addresses controlled by keypairs established in the lockdrop process. No claiming is necessary, secure your keys.

## Is there a guide for validators participating in the lockdrop?
