# Intro to Polkadot UI

The [Polkadot UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer) is an essential l interface for performing a variety of actions on Edgeware and Substrate-based chains. It will be the primary way that you interact with the Edgeware network, whether that is staking, account transactions, some governance functions, or more. 

Secondary to the Polkadot UI is [Commonwealth.im](http://Commonwealth.im), which combines discussion and polling on-chain with governance and account functions. As Commonwealth is still under development, many instructions on this site will be written for Polkadot UI.
