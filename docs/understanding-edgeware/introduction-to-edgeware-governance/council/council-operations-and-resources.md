# Council Operations and Resources

## Treasury

When adopting a treasury proposal via Polkadot UI, the 'Send to Council' Button may present the opportunity to set a 'threshold'. This is a threshold of agreement, so if the threshold is 8, then 8 councilpeople must approve it, and then, only if that is fulfilled, the logic checks the on-chain parameters for other thresholds, supermajority, etc.  If that also passes, then the treasury proposal now council motion is accepted and processed.
