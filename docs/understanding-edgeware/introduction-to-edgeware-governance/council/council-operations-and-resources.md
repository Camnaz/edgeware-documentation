# Council Operations and Resources

## Treasury

When adopting a treasury proposal via Polkadot UI, the 'Send to Council' Button may present the opportunity to set a 'threshold'. This is a threshold of agreement, so if the threshold is 8, then 8 councilpeople must approve it, and then, only if that is fulfilled, the logic checks the on-chain parameters for other thresholds, supermajority, etc.  If that also passes, then the treasury proposal now council motion is accepted and processed. 



## Council Motions

Motions to accept are separate from motions to reject, each is it's own standalone proposal.  

Duplicate proposals are not accepted by the system while one is active.

You can manipulate the threshold of Motions to reject to prevent easy rejections because a lower threshold version cannot be submitted, reason being that it is a duplicate.  This may be considered a bug, exploit, or other unintended use.
