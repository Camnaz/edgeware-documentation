# Treasury

Edgeware uses a treasury mechanism to achieve self-sustainability and permit creative incentivization of all stakeholders in the ecosystem, including core and dapp development, ecosystem support and much more. 

These funds can be deployed through a Treasury Spend action which is subject to council approval. 

### EDG Accrual to the Treasury

The treasury obtains funds in several ways that mimic governments - minting, fees and taxes.

1. **Minting:** A portion of the EDG produced with each block goes to the treasury.
2. **Slashing:** When a validator is slashed for any reason, the slashed amount is sent to the Treasury. Slashed EDG may also accrue to the treasury through failed governance proposals.
3. **Transaction fees**: A portion of each block's transaction fees goes to the Treasury, with the remainder going to the block author.
4. **Staking inefficiency:** [Inflation](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-staking#inflation) is designed to be ~20% in the first year, and the ideal staking ratio is set at 80%, meaning 80% of all tokens should be locked in staking. Any deviation from this ratio will cause a proportional amount of the inflation to go to the Treasury. In other words, if 80% of all tokens are staked, then 100% of the inflation goes to the validators as reward. If the staking rate is greater than or less than 80%, then the validators will receive less, with the remainder going to the Treasury.
5. **Lost Deposits:** These may be abandoned bonds from voting, proposals or otherwise.

**Parameter Note:** The _ideal staking ratio_ used in the Edgeware economic model is currently 80%.  _Inflation_ is currently set to about 20%, or 158 EDG per block.
