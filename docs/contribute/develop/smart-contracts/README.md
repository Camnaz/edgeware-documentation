# Smart Contracts

Edgeware is capable to run EVM and ink! smart contracts. If you are looking how, you can learn at dedicated site to [smart contracts on Edgeware](https://contracts.edgewa.re/) 


### Learn

We setup completely new site for this purpose at [contracts.edgewa.re](contracts.edgewa.re) where you can find resoruces to learn [from setup your enviroment](https://contracts.edgewa.re/#/0/introduction), through [WASM Basics](https://contracts.edgewa.re/#/1/introduction), deploy your [WASM ERC20](https://contracts.edgewa.re/#/2/introduction) and finally play around with [EVM Basics on Edgeware](https://contracts.edgewa.re/#/4/evm-introduction)
