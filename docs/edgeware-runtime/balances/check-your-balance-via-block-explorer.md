# check-your-balance-via-block-explorer

At this time, the two main block explorers are

* [Polkascan](https://polkascan.io/pre/edgeware-berlin)
* [Subscan](https://edgeware.subscan.io/)

Both of these explorers will only work with Public Addresses \(SS58\) that have the Edgeware network ID encoded.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have not re-encoded your public address from you Lockdrop-created keypair with the new Edgeware network ID, you **must do so** in order to use block explorers to find your account. Follow the instructions linked below.
{% endhint %}

Once you have your re-encoded Public Address, you can enter it into the search bar in a block explorer to pull up your account and view the balance.
