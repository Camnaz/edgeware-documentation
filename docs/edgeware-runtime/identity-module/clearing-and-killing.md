# Clearing and Killing

**Clearing:** Users can clear their identity information and have their deposit returned. Clearing an identity also clears all sub accounts and returns their deposits.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Killing:** The Council can kill an identity that it deems erroneous. **This results in a slash of the deposit.**
{% endhint %}

Clearing is done through the [Extrinsics UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/extrinsics).
